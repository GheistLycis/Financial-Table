# Financial-Table
Personal project for monthly expenses management with interactive interface. [Nest.js 9 + Angular 15]

ONGOING PROJECT

This project's main aim is to provide an interactive and easy way to manage your daily expenses and plan your months. It's like Excel... but better.

Basically, you create your own categories and groups and register your expenses in them. The app will not only list them for you but also give you real-time analytics with info about all your recent financial behaviors from different points of view with graphs and dashboards.
